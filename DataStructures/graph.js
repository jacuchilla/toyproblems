/* A graph contains a set of vertices and a set of edges. Edges are defined 
as a pair (v1,v2), where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph. A vertix can 
also have a weight, which is comtimes called a cost. A graph whose pairs are 
ordered is called a directed graph, or just a diagraph. When pairs are ordered
in a directed graph, an arrow is drawn from one pair to another pair. Directed 
graphs indicate the flow direction from vertex to vertex. A path is a sequence
of vertices in a graph such that all vertices in the path are connected by edges.
The length of a path is the number of edges from the first vertex in the path 
to the last vertex. A path can also consist of a vertex to itself, which is 
called a loop.
